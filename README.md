Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

📄 Problem Statement

This project analyzes the direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. These campaigns involved phone calls, often requiring multiple contacts to determine if a client would subscribe to a bank term deposit.

The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit (yes/no), based on campaign-related data.

🧠 Project Approach

1. Data Exploration

Understanding the dataset, its 21 features, and identifying patterns or correlations.

Discarded the output column (y) initially to explore independent variables.

2. Feature Engineering

Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and outliers.

Selected the most relevant independent variables to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. Building Samples

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test samples for robust model evaluation.

4. Model Selection

Evaluated the following classifiers:

SGD: Stochastic Gradient Descent (used once as a baseline and once with optimized hyperparameters).

RF: Random Forest (used once as a baseline and once with optimized hyperparameters).

GB: Gradient Boosting (used once as a baseline and once with optimized hyperparameters).

5. Model Evaluation

Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Optimized the hyperparameters for the best-performing model.

🔿 Project Goals

The primary objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit (yes/no) by leveraging data-driven insights. The secondary goal is to identify key features influencing customer behavior and use these insights to optimize marketing strategies.

🏆 Results and Key Insights

Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieving:

Accuracy: 79.5%

Precision: 0.82

Identified 62% of potential subscribers.

Key Features:

Consumer Price Index (cons.price.idx): High values positively influenced subscriptions.

Euribor 3-month Rate (euribor3m): High values were a strong indicator for subscriptions.

Business Insight:

Targeting customers with high cons.price.idx and euribor3m values can enhance the campaign's efficiency by focusing on high-potential clients, saving resources, and driving growth.
